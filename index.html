        <p>While the Indian education system concentrates on loading as much information as possible in the minds of the students, it rarely enables the teachers to draw out their inherent potential. The change was needed to stop teachers from directing and feeding in answers in the minds of the learners; to bring about a paradigm shift by getting the teachers to become facilitators of knowledge; and to help the learners to extract solutions, question preset theories and be responsive and adaptable. Thus, a unique pedagogy had to be built to fulfill this vision and philosophy.

            Another factor to be kept in mind is that children need to become equipped with 21st century skills, social and emotional skills while developing themselves in areas they have talent in. They need to be proficient in creative and critical thinking, analysis, reasoning, problem solving, synthesis, data handling, applying their learning, and presentation skills. They need the best pedagogic practices, the latest technological tools and liberation from the tyranny of rote learning.

            At the end of the years of schooling, the confident and responsible person that needs to emerge out of the school system requires careful nurturing. Thus, the system needs to be given opportunities to build values unconsciously in the minds of the child so s/he becomes an asset to society and becomes a harbinger of progress.

            To enable progressive and aware parents to provide such learning opportunities to their children, the Millennium Learning SystemTM was developed. Over the years, it has evolved and now is replete with a complete solution to each aspect of education, including content in various forms for children, facilitators and even for parents.

It ensures a learning continuum for all educators. The training is imparted in a phased manner for easy absorption.


            Empowering Facilitators with Effective Strategies Program (EFES) <br>

            This is a unique dimension to facilitator empowerment training by the Research and Development. Every teacher of The Millennium School undergoes an additional online certification course, so as to be equipped with meaningful strategies practiced in classrooms all over the world. Here teaching strategies are disseminated in the form of short films and videos.

            The World Education Summit has felicitated the EFES program with the award for the Best Innovation in Teaching Methodologies in 2011.
